# Arty Z7-10 Bring-up (Bare-metal → U-Boot)

This repository documents the early bring-up process of a Zynq-7000
based system (Digilent Arty Z7-10), from FSBL execution to bare-metal
application validation, and toward U-Boot/Linux boot.

---

## Boot Position

BootROM → FSBL → **Bare-metal App (this repo)** → (optional) U-Boot → Linux

- The bare-metal application runs **after FSBL**
- No OS / no MMU at this stage
- Direct hardware access is possible

---

## Purpose

- Validate early bring-up after FSBL
- Verify UART input/output
- Understand linker script and physical memory layout
- Establish first user-controlled execution point
- Prepare for U-Boot and Linux transition

---

## Source Structure

- `src/helloworld.c`
  - UART input parsing
  - Numeric validation
  - Simple execution loop
- `src/platform.c`, `src/platform.h`
  - Platform initialization (UART, caches)
- `src/lscript.ld`
  - Memory layout and section placement
- `src/Xilinx.spec`
  - BSP specification for Vitis

---

## Boot Components (Overall Project Scope)

- FSBL: built using Vitis (standalone)
- Bitstream: generated by Vivado
- U-Boot: built from u-boot-xlnx
- BOOT.bin: generated via bootgen

---

## Environment

- Board: Arty Z7-10
- SoC: Zynq-7000 (XC7Z010)
- CPU: ARM Cortex-A9
- Host OS: Ubuntu 22.04 (WSL2)
- Toolchain: Vivado / Vitis 2022.2
- Execution mode: Bare-metal (no MMU, no OS)

---

## Notes

- No user/kernel separation at this stage
- Flat physical addressing
- Debuggable via JTAG
