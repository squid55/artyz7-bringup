# Arty Z7-10 Bring-up (FSBL + U-Boot)
This repository documents the early bring-up process of a Zynq-7000
based system (Digilent Arty Z7-10) up to BOOT.bin generation.
## Environment
- Board: Arty Z7-10
- SoC: Zynq-7000 (XC7Z010)
- Host OS: Ubuntu 22.04 (WSL2)
- Vivado / Vitis: 2022.2
- Bootgen: Xilinx Bootgen v2022.2
## Boot Components
- FSBL: built using Vitis (standalone)
- Bitstream: generated by Vivado
- U-Boot: built from u-boot-xlnx
- BOOT.bin: generated via bootgen

### Status
- [x] BOOT.bin generated
- [ ] SD boot verified
- [ ] U-Boot prompt confirmed

## Bring-up Attempt: SD Card Boot (Failed)

At the early stage of bring-up, SD card boot was attempted first.
This choice was made by following common Zynq bring-up examples,
without sufficient understanding of the Arty Z7-10 board boot characteristics.

### Configuration
- Boot Mode Jumper: SD
- SD Card:
  - FAT32 formatted
  - BOOT.bin placed in root directory
- BOOT.bin contents:
  - FSBL (fsbl.elf)
  - PL bitstream (.bit)
- UART:
  - 115200 baud
  - USB-UART (FTDI) confirmed working

### Observed Behavior
- No UART output on power-up
- No UART output after reset
- Re-formatting SD card and re-copying BOOT.bin did not change behavior
- FSBL execution could not be observed

### Verification
The following checks were performed to isolate the issue:
- UART cable, COM port, and terminal settings verified
- Same UART setup produced logs when booting from QSPI
- BOOT.bin generation verified (bootgen completed successfully)
- FSBL confirmed working when used in QSPI boot

### Result
| Boot Mode | UART Output |
|----------|-------------|
| QSPI     | Yes         |
| SD       | No          |
| JTAG     | No          |

Based on these results, the issue was determined not to be BOOT.bin or FSBL,
but the SD boot path on this board configuration.

### Decision
- SD card boot was abandoned as a primary bring-up path
- QSPI was selected as the baseline boot device
- Subsequent bring-up and debugging proceeded using QSPI
- SD card retained only as secondary storage
